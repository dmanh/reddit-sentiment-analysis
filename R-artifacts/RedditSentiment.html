  <tr> <td align="right"> 1 </td> <td> CrazyAboutCode </td> <td> Hey 
Reddit! We're a bunch of developers who like to talk to people. So 
stereotypes be damned. We work at IBM and like to talk about app 
infrastructure, app delivery and app tool projects (some of our favorite
 projects: PureApp, Bluemix, WebSphere, Urban Code and WAS Liberty). 
We're going to answer tech questions virtually in this Reddit AMA at 
12:00pm EST and in real life at DeveloperConnect. Feel free to ask us 
anything you want! 

Participating Panelists:
Ram Vennam -- Bluemix Developer Advocate /
Steve A. Mirman -- WebSphere &amp;amp; Mobility SWAT Team - East IMT /
Richard Irving -- Certified IT Specialist /
Joshua Carr -- Technical Liaison, IBM Developer Outreach 

Check here for our proof and additional info: http://ibm.co/1hlPW1D

EDIT 1: Thanks for all the great questions everyone! We had a ton of fun
 answering them. We're wrapping up now, time to get back to our day 
jobs. You can find most of us on our twitter handle @IBMWebSphere. 
We’ll also be attending and speaking at Developer Connect 
(http://ibm.co/1JoAefe), if you’d like to come see us in person!  

EDIT 2: I (~Joshua) have gone to bed as it's now 1AM, it's been really 
fun to chat here. I appreciate all the comments and questions, even the 
ones about lotus notes! Goodnight.  </td> </tr>

One of the things I remember most that my professor mentioned about IBM 
as a business is that it has non-management tracks for engineers / 
developers to progress.  Essentially this was to ensure that the best 
engineers aren't "lost" to management simply in order to move up in rank
 or earn higher levels of pay.  The way it was described, people would 
the same level of decision-making authority as managers, but would still
 focus on the engineering work and wouldn't have anyone working under 
them.

 breaking, to Offense generation and rules logic collapse. Please

I a Windows/MSSQL developer and part of my job requires interacting with
 AS/400 RPG developers on a daily basis.  We have systems running on 
MSSQL, and systems on the iSeries written in RPG, and they have to talk 
to each other.

I connect to the iSeries DB2 database like any other.  It has tables, 
indexes, views, stored procedures, it responds to standard SQL queries 
like SELECTs and UPDATEs, all the stuff you'd expect from any relational
 database platform. 

When I speak with the RPG programmers, they have absolutely no idea what
 I'm talking about.  They refer to everything as "physical files" or 
"logical files" and always throw fits about adding columns or schema 
changes of any kind.  Physical files are pretty much tables from what I 
gather, but logical files are more like indexes or views.  What I call a
 "schema" they call a "library" which sounds more like a file folder.

Can you explain to me why?  I struggle with this communication gap on a 
daily basis.  Thanks </td> </tr>

I a Windows/MSSQL developer and part of my job requires interacting with
 AS/400 RPG developers on a daily basis.  We have systems running on 
MSSQL, and systems on the iSeries written in RPG, and they have to talk 
to each other.

I connect to the iSeries DB2 database like any other.  It has tables, 
indexes, views, stored procedures, it responds to standard SQL queries 
like SELECTs and UPDATEs, all the stuff you'd expect from any relational
 database platform. 

When I speak with the RPG programmers, they have absolutely no idea what
 I'm talking about.  They refer to everything as "physical files" or 
"logical files" and always throw fits about adding columns or schema 
changes of any kind.  Physical files are pretty much tables from what I 
gather, but logical files are more like indexes or views.  What I call a
 "schema" they call a "library" which sounds more like a file folder.

Can you explain to me why?  I struggle with this communication gap on a 
daily basis.  Thanks </td> </tr>

Our company was granted an evaluation license to test Urbancode Deploy

We're looking for a plugin that shows approvals, pipeline, phases,

with IBM only has BMC Remedy Action Request and ServiceNow.

One of the things I remember most that my professor mentioned about IBM 
as a business is that it has non-management tracks for engineers / 
developers to progress.  Essentially this was to ensure that the best 
engineers aren't "lost" to management simply in order to move up in rank
 or earn higher levels of pay.  The way it was described, people would 
the same level of decision-making authority as managers, but would still
 focus on the engineering work and wouldn't have anyone working under 
them.

few technical questions here :

* CPU architecture and market

With x86/amd64 beeing so bloated ([see the last BlackHat 
release](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Domas-The-Memory-Sinkhole-Unleashing-An-x86-Design-Flaw-Allowing-Universal-Privilege-Escalation-wp.pdf)),
 ARM beeing so cheap and ludicrously efficient on mobile and desktop 
loads (even some server loads), Where's PPC now ? How did it evolve 
since its last release in a user-facing maket (Power4 / G5) ? Is there 
any potential use other than the Power server CPUs ?

* OS / Unices

I used to run some AIX powered boxes, but now everyone at IBM seems 
focused on Linux. I see a discrepency there : AIX and other old school 
Unices had a somehow pragmatic and light design, closer to what modern 
BSD sticks to. Why don't IBM work with FreeBSD, OpenBSD, instead of 
sticking to a "throw everything from drivers to clustering filesystems 
in the same pile of cra^Wcode" kind of kernel ?

And BTW, what's your opinion on Systemd ?

* CS History

Appart from the iSeries, what does remain from the AS400 era ? If it's 
beeing phased-out, is there any chance its architecture could one day be
 well documented as to let hobbyist maintain some of them or re-use them
 for fun ? Would install media images and softwares be released as 
abandonwares someday ? Same could apply to OS/2, OS390, and maybe some 
other platforms…

I a Windows/MSSQL developer and part of my job requires interacting with
 AS/400 RPG developers on a daily basis.  We have systems running on 
MSSQL, and systems on the iSeries written in RPG, and they have to talk 
to each other.

I connect to the iSeries DB2 database like any other.  It has tables, 
indexes, views, stored procedures, it responds to standard SQL queries 
like SELECTs and UPDATEs, all the stuff you'd expect from any relational
 database platform. 

When I speak with the RPG programmers, they have absolutely no idea what
 I'm talking about.  They refer to everything as "physical files" or 
"logical files" and always throw fits about adding columns or schema 
changes of any kind.  Physical files are pretty much tables from what I 
gather, but logical files are more like indexes or views.  What I call a
 "schema" they call a "library" which sounds more like a file folder.

Can you explain to me why?  I struggle with this communication gap on a 
daily basis.  Thanks </td> </tr>

I a Windows/MSSQL developer and part of my job requires interacting with
 AS/400 RPG developers on a daily basis.  We have systems running on 
MSSQL, and systems on the iSeries written in RPG, and they have to talk 
to each other.

I connect to the iSeries DB2 database like any other.  It has tables, 
indexes, views, stored procedures, it responds to standard SQL queries 
like SELECTs and UPDATEs, all the stuff you'd expect from any relational
 database platform. 

When I speak with the RPG programmers, they have absolutely no idea what
 I'm talking about.  They refer to everything as "physical files" or 
"logical files" and always throw fits about adding columns or schema 
changes of any kind.  Physical files are pretty much tables from what I 
gather, but logical files are more like indexes or views.  What I call a
 "schema" they call a "library" which sounds more like a file folder.

Can you explain to me why?  I struggle with this communication gap on a 
daily basis.  Thanks </td> </tr>

few technical questions here :

* CPU architecture and market

With x86/amd64 beeing so bloated ([see the last BlackHat 
release](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Domas-The-Memory-Sinkhole-Unleashing-An-x86-Design-Flaw-Allowing-Universal-Privilege-Escalation-wp.pdf)),
 ARM beeing so cheap and ludicrously efficient on mobile and desktop 
loads (even some server loads), Where's PPC now ? How did it evolve 
since its last release in a user-facing maket (Power4 / G5) ? Is there 
any potential use other than the Power server CPUs ?

* OS / Unices

I used to run some AIX powered boxes, but now everyone at IBM seems 
focused on Linux. I see a discrepency there : AIX and other old school 
Unices had a somehow pragmatic and light design, closer to what modern 
BSD sticks to. Why don't IBM work with FreeBSD, OpenBSD, instead of 
sticking to a "throw everything from drivers to clustering filesystems 
in the same pile of cra^Wcode" kind of kernel ?

And BTW, what's your opinion on Systemd ?

* CS History

Appart from the iSeries, what does remain from the AS400 era ? If it's 
beeing phased-out, is there any chance its architecture could one day be
 well documented as to let hobbyist maintain some of them or re-use them
 for fun ? Would install media images and softwares be released as 
abandonwares someday ? Same could apply to OS/2, OS390, and maybe some 
other platforms…

The annual pay increases can't be that good. But IBM is the only company
 where you talk to a resource and they've been there, like, 30 years. 
Every time. "We're implementing a new Z series mainframe, you got anyone
 free during our window?" "Yeah, these two guys have been here 25+ years
 doing mainframes". "Ok then". </td> </tr>

few technical questions here :

* CPU architecture and market

With x86/amd64 beeing so bloated ([see the last BlackHat 
release](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-15/materials/us-15-Domas-The-Memory-Sinkhole-Unleashing-An-x86-Design-Flaw-Allowing-Universal-Privilege-Escalation-wp.pdf)),
 ARM beeing so cheap and ludicrously efficient on mobile and desktop 
loads (even some server loads), Where's PPC now ? How did it evolve 
since its last release in a user-facing maket (Power4 / G5) ? Is there 
any potential use other than the Power server CPUs ?

* OS / Unices

I used to run some AIX powered boxes, but now everyone at IBM seems 
focused on Linux. I see a discrepency there : AIX and other old school 
Unices had a somehow pragmatic and light design, closer to what modern 
BSD sticks to. Why don't IBM work with FreeBSD, OpenBSD, instead of 
sticking to a "throw everything from drivers to clustering filesystems 
in the same pile of cra^Wcode" kind of kernel ?

And BTW, what's your opinion on Systemd ?

* CS History

Appart from the iSeries, what does remain from the AS400 era ? If it's 
beeing phased-out, is there any chance its architecture could one day be
 well documented as to let hobbyist maintain some of them or re-use them
 for fun ? Would install media images and softwares be released as 
abandonwares someday ? Same could apply to OS/2, OS390, and maybe some 
other platforms…

I a Windows/MSSQL developer and part of my job requires interacting with
 AS/400 RPG developers on a daily basis.  We have systems running on 
MSSQL, and systems on the iSeries written in RPG, and they have to talk 
to each other.

I connect to the iSeries DB2 database like any other.  It has tables, 
indexes, views, stored procedures, it responds to standard SQL queries 
like SELECTs and UPDATEs, all the stuff you'd expect from any relational
 database platform. 

When I speak with the RPG programmers, they have absolutely no idea what
 I'm talking about.  They refer to everything as "physical files" or 
"logical files" and always throw fits about adding columns or schema 
changes of any kind.  Physical files are pretty much tables from what I 
gather, but logical files are more like indexes or views.  What I call a
 "schema" they call a "library" which sounds more like a file folder.

Can you explain to me why?  I struggle with this communication gap on a 
daily basis.  Thanks </td> </tr>

Hello.  I am a software developer at company that purchased WebSphere.  
We ended up not using it because of how cumbersome updating web pages 
was within our app.

My question for you is: What are the advantages of using a product like 
IBM WebSphere over open source technologies (LAMP) besides support and 
the more rigid security of Java? </td> </tr>
