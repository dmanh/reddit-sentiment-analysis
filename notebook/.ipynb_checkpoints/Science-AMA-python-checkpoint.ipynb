I often think of leaving academia to do something else - such as create a startup - but two things, mainly, prevent me and I'd be interested to hear if you had to deal with these issues and how.  The first is IP/copyright.  In my university, our contract states that anything we work on effectively belongs to the university.  So if I start something before I leave there is a chance the uni might claim it.  The second is how much of a chance am i taking by leaving.  For example, how much market research did you do before you left academia to convince yourself that it was worth the chance, and did you have finance already lined up?  Thanks.\n",

The first is IP/copyright.  In my university, our contract states that anything we work on effectively belongs to the university.  So if I start something before I leave there is a chance the uni might claim it.  The second is how much of a chance am i taking by leaving.

Certainly it is here to stay, as electronic publishing has vastly increased the volume of papers (both good and bad), it has changed the expectations of how often an academic should publish.  Whereas when paper documents had to be shuttled around between the author, publisher, and reviewers, there was increase inertia to publication that limited the number of publications one could produce, so that perhaps one or two publications a year was acceptable, now electronic publishing has created an \"arms race\" where in order to keep one's CV distinguished above one's peers, publishing multiple times per year is required.  I believe this has resulted in yet more incremental, piecemeal publications that further dilute the content of research over more articles and journals.
